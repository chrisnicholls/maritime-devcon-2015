# Machine Learning Demo
Here you can find the code for the demo portion of my talk at [Maritime Devcon 2015](http://maritimedevcon.ca/) on Machine Learning. For the slides, [go here](http://prezi.com/5khdrlqccrtq).

The code is in the form of [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which you should definitely try out! But alternatively, you can view the notebooks in html form at:
1. [Prepare The Data](http://chrisnicholls.github.io/maritime-devcon-2015/PrepareTheData.html)
2. [Demo](http://chrisnicholls.github.io/maritime-devcon-2015/Demo.html)

## Requirements
In order to run through the examples you will need to install [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Download) - this is the link to the source version but there are binaries available for all the popular platforms.
